  <p>In 2000 I pass my entrance examination for the Spanish Military Officer cadet Academy, after a car accident I found my way through the bachelor degree in Hospitality Management in the Swiss Hotel School "<a href="https://lesroches.edu/es/campus/marbella/">Les Roches Marbella</a>". I enrolled
    management trainings in Leading hotels like Mandarin Oriental London and <a href="https://www.puenteromano.com/">Hotel Puente Romano 5* GL</a> as Duty Manager.
    As Front Office skills I joined Marriott´s as Supervisor in the Renaissance Brussels Hotel improving my French language skills being transferred to Marriott's Marbella Beach Resort getting promoted & transferred two year after as Front Office
    Manager to Marriott's Playa Andaluza where we consistently achieved 95.5% guest experience scores.
    To extend my hotel management skills I joined the Hotel Fuerte Marbella as Deputy Manager contributing to operations new challenges. We improved our Booking.com rating from 8.9 to 9.1, achieved for the first time a 82% in our Associate
    satisfaction survey and increased our GOP for over 4% from our 2019 Goal.
    In 2020 I have been appointed as Key Operations User assisting the Company's CEO in projects as Housekeeping PMS development & implementation, Plastic policies, redesign company´s VIP product line between many others.
    I am enthusiastic managing successful teams to the Top Performing levels, and I am looking forward to join bigger projects related to Hotel Operations.</p>
